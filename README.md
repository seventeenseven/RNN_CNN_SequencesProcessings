# DeepLearning_RNN_CNN_SequencesProcessings

This project focuses on processing emulated time series sequences using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term-Memory (LSTMs) for forecasting. It also addresses the SketchRNN dataset with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to predict over 50 classes. It provides a Jupyter notebook to explore these sequence processing techniques.

## Main points of functionality
* Use of RNN, in particular LSTM networks, for processing sequences
* Using CNN for Image multi-classification
* Exploration of sequence processing techniques in a Jupyter notebook

## Technology stack
* Recurrent neural networks (RNN)
* Long-term memory neural networks (LSTM)
* Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
* Jupyter Notebook

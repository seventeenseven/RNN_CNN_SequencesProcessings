# DeepLearning_RNN_CNN_SequencesProcessings

This project focuses on emulated time series sequence processing using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTM (Long Short Term-Memory) for forecasting. We also tackle the SketchRNN Dataset with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model to predict more than 50 classes. It provides a Jupyter notebook to explore these sequence processing techniques.

## Main points of functionality
* Use of RNN, in particular LSTM networks, for processing sequences
* Using CNN for Image multi-classification
* Exploration of sequence processing techniques in a Jupyter notebook

## Technology stack
* Recurrent neural networks (RNN)
* Long-term memory neural networks (LSTM)
* Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
* Jupyter Notebook
